# Rock Climbing / Parkour / Gymnastics-adjacent
I like moving my body a lot. I practiced gymnastics regularly before undergrad. Parkour and Bouldering crept into my life during my undergraduate years. Took a few years off when the world of adults hit me like a bag of rocks, and picked these all back up returning to school for my PhD. 

# Tabletop RPGs (TTRPGS)
DND, Pathfinder, Shadowrun, the whole lot. When you find the right group, the experience is like no other. This stuff can be a wonderful and creative outlet.

# Weightlifting
There's something incredibly cathartic and therapeutic about lifting heavy objects. 

# Snowboarding
Gotta go fast on long steep mountain face. If you get it, you get it.
